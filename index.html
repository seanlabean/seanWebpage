								<p>My name is Sean Lewis. I am originally from Sunnyvale, California and moved to Philadelphia in 2017 to pursue my dream of being an astrophysicist. I have worked as a computational astrophysicist and Research Fellow at Drexel University where my research focuses on the modeling of star cluster formation. I am extremely proud of my work. I've entirely fulfilled my ambitions of being a scientist and I cannot wait to apply the wealth of skills I have developed to endeavors a bit more local than the cosmos. In addition to my love of astronomy, I love computer science and the intricacies of software development. Hence, after receiving my Ph.D. I joined a software development company in Philadelphia. I enjoy challenging myself and devling deep into concepts I have little knowledge of to see what I can create. Through this effort I have produced numerous projects of which a few I describe in my <a href="./blog/index.html">Blog</a>. Otherwise, I love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126213750-sean-lewis">reading</a>, running, and cooking.</p>
								<p>I received my Ph.D. and Masters degree in physics from Drexel Univeristy in 2019. Prior to graduate school, I received my B.S. in physics at California Polytechnic State University &mdash; San Luis Obispo in 2016.</p>

								<p>My research is now three-fold. There is of course my thesis work for my Ph.D. which I describe below. I also have delved deep into random topics of interest which I compile and lay out <a href="./blog/site/nexus.html">in my Nexus</a>. And lastly my current research revolves around my job as a data scientist and my passion projects as a video game designer. While you are here, please enjoy my ramblings about my thesis project:</p>
								<p>There is a common misconception that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics">astrophysics</a> are interchangeable, one in the same. I see astronomy as the deceptively broad catagory of science of all things outside of our world, the study of what the universe is like. Astrophysics, on the other hand, is the study of <em>how</em> the universe works. But even within this category, astrophysicists have incredibly diverse disciplines. With four astrophysicists in a room, one may study planets, another stars, and the other two study black holes but one focuses on the radiation emitted from ancient active galactic nuclei and the other the theoretical implications of warped space-time. In essence, despite having the same disciplinary title, it's entirely possible each of these four astrophysicists would have no idea what the others are talking about. Such is life in the hyper-specialized world of science.</p>

								<p>My specialty is the computational modeling of the formation of star clusters. Stars all form from the collapse of gas in a giant molecular cloud (GMC). The vast maojrity of stars also form in clusters, spatially compact systems where hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of stars closely interact gravitationally with one another. So where does my work come in? Why are computational models necessary to study this? Observing star cluster formation is notoriously difficult. The process of GMC collapse, the formation of individual stars, and the hierarchical assembly of the star cluster takes place over hundreds of thousands or millions of years. The nearest regions of star cluster formation are not only many thousands of lightyears away, but they also tend to reside deep within GMC structures which block our ability to watch the formation of the embedded clusters. But, we are able to observe star clusters that have successfully formed and cleared their surroundings of dense obscuring gas. Therefore we know what the star cluster formation process results in, but it is currently unknown how that processs gets to the point of completion. It is my job as a computational astrophysicist to help find out <em>how</em> star cluster formation works. This is a particularly difficult task since the star formation process is incredibly complex. Such simulation require detailed magnetohydrodynamics, realistic heating and cooling of gas, gravitational interactions between stars and stars and gas, and radiative and both radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms from massive stars (ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae).</p>

								<p>My thesis is two-fold. First, I test the hypothesis that the <em>timing</em> of massive star formation has significant effects on the star cluster formation process. Specifically, that early-forming massive stars supress subsequent star formation and stifles the hierarchical cluster assembly process. Secondly, I have built a revolutionary tool which bridges two types of hydrodynamical data structures: Voronoi meshes and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) grids. This tool allows output data from Voronoi mesh codes (which excel at simulating rotating gas and particle structures such as galaxies) to be converted into input data for AMR codes (which are faster and more capable at resolving intense shocks). My tool can ultimately be used to bridge the gap between galaxy simulations and detailed simulations of individual star forming regions, a feat which is computationally impossible to achieve with any single simulation.</p>

								<p>Other than astrophysics, my endeavors as a Ph.D. candidate have also resulted in several computer science projects of which I am particularly proud. I built a parallel processing Python library that utilizes MPI packages to allow for more efficient task-based parallel processing rather than the slower data-based processing. From scratch, using only numpy Python libraries, I built a customizable L-layer neural network with any number n neurons per layer. I have also amassed an enormous array of data visualization routines, some taking advantage of my parallel processing library, and others utilizing other visualization-specific packages to generate images fit for presentations at conferences such as the American Astronomical Society (AAS-233, AAS-236) at which I received the Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Graduate Student Honorable Mention for my poster presentation.</p>

								<p>To have learned is to be able to teach. To be able to teach is to understand concepts at a granular level. In my classes, I expect my students to become learners of physics but to become teachers of it too. Physics is a difficult subject, as an educator, I owe my students so much more than just working through practice problems. I truly enjoy breaking complicated physics concepts down into bite-sized pieces and seeing the resulting epiphany "ah-ha" moments in my students. Through my experience of using this engaged approach to teaching, I am convinced that <em>anyone</em> can succeed in physics.</p>
								<p>I am a teaching assistant at Drexel University. I have been a recitation instructor and grader for the calculus-based introductory physics courses PHYS101: Fundamentals of Physics I, PHYS102: Fundamentals of Physics II, PHYS201: Fundamentals of Physics III, and PHYS121: Physics for Art and Design Students. I was also a grader for PHYS431: Galactic Astrophysics. In 2019, I was honored by the Drexel Physics Department with a Teaching Excellence Award. In 2022 I was nominated to receive the graduate college <a href="https://drexel.edu/graduatecollege/research-funding/excellence-awards/ta-excellence/2022-ta-winners/">TA Excellence Award</a>. I have taught in person and remotely. While I prefer teaching in person, I have a robust remote teaching system which allows me to graphically explain complex topics in detail.</p>
								<p>Since 2020, I've also led the yearly Python-based coding workshop for incoming physics graduate students the code for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/seanlabean/DrexelCodingLessons">on my Github</a>. In the workshop we cover everything from the basics of coding (data types, mathematical expressions, lists, arrays) to much more complex topics (statistical analysis, parallel processing, machine learning). We also discuss vital resource systems such as <code>git</code>.</p>
