# Sean's Webpage

Built off of the al-folio template: originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).

## Purpose

As a challenge to myself, I wanted to create and maintain my personal webspace provided by Drexel University: [Sean's Page](https://physics.drexel.edu/~slewis/). The hope is to use this as a professional blog/self-advertisement.

## Other

Currently a work in progress...
