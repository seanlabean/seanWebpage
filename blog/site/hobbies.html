      <h2>What are hobbies to me</h2>
      <p>
        At times I see myself as sinfully simple. I've engage in a seemingly relentless struggle to "find a hobby", to find something that interests me or a thing that <em>should</em> interest me. I've resorted to Youtube videos "How to find a hobby", "10 cheap, fun hobbies", "Best hobbies for someone in their late 20s". The consistent problem I've recognized within myself is a reluctance to persevere when the hobby in question becomes tedious, or difficult, or not what I envisioned. 
      </p>
      <p>  
        For a while, I was under the impression that there was something faulty with my approach to hobbies, or something wrong with how my mind worked. Was my attention span fucked from being on the internet too much? Has my ability to persevere always been lacking? Am I an insufficient person, am I simply someone with no sustained interests at all? A dark line of questioning indeed, enough to stifle anyone's curiosity to try something new. The last question though briefly piqued my interest, maybe I was just someone who had many interests, ones that lasted only a month or two at a time. And I still believe there is some virtue to accepting this as a personality quirk of mine, though I'll touch on this elsewhere. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Though perhaps the most critical realization is one of forced expedience. To develop a hobby, the most simple thing is to do SOMETHING. That something being literally anything. It is fundamentally impossible to have a hobby without putting in the time. In that sense, I was consistently failing by spending more time thinking about what hobbies would be the best for me or most interesting or most cost effective when I should have just tried them. Put in the time <b>(PITT)</b> and even if the hobby fails spectacularly, I will have gained a better understanding of myself and my interests and what I value most. Life is built of experiences, learn by doing, don't waste away in a mire of speculation.

      <h3>Books</h3>

        I really like <a href="books.html">reading</a>. This was a relatively new discovery of mine, but it does in fact turn out that I cannot get enough of reading. I love starting a new book, I love finishing a book, keeping track of how many I've read, reviewing them, thinking about which to read next. Reading was my first attempt at PITT, facillitated by my want to accumulate a modestly impressive list of books read and a new arena of conversation. I was also motivated by my inability to answer the question: "what kind of book do you like?" I've since discovered that the question is still diffucult to answer even with numerous books under my belt. But nonetheless, I still enjoy my attempts to provide and answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading has been my most sucessful hobby thus far with nearly 5 dozen books read between 2019 and 2022, and no reason to stop any time soon!
