      <h2>From January 2023</h2>
      <h3>Letter to Nia Imara</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          Hello Dr. Imara,
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Sean Lewis, I'm an astrophysics graduate student at Drexel University in Philadelphia. I've found myself repeatedly fascinated by people with the ability to create. In my eyes, people like yourself possess this extraordinary talent and drive to create, to generate art from a thought and onto the page or into the air. When it comes to myself I've always adored the idea of making things for people, whether it be software or drawings, or poems. But I have a constant paralysis, a nagging weight that has held me back from committing and putting in the time necessary to hone my skills as a creator. I can't truly see myself as an artist, despite my efforts. I second-guess myself and doubt my ability to succeed: "it will take so much work to be as good as [insert artist here]", "everyone knows I'm an amateur, no one will take me seriously", "I don't take myself seriously”. But at the same time I want to create. I want to show people what I can make, who I am. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As an artist and a scientist, how have you dealt with the feelings of self-doubt? Is the remedy simply a matter of putting in the time, no matter what? Do you believe that there is such a thing as a “creative spirit” that can be nurtured and developed? Have your artistic interests waxed and waned over time, shifted from medium to medium? Have any of your artistic endeavors failed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you very much for your time. Thank you for your talk today at AAS, you are a wonderful speaker and storyteller. 
        </p>
        <p>

      <h3>Traffic and Birdsong</h3>

        The Henry Avenue Bridge was built nearly one-hundred years ago and the trail that cuts beneath it is a mere five minute drive from our apartment. The trail mostly winds through the Wissahickon state park, a densely forested rift mostly devoid of any "unnatural" infrastructure. And though the bridge stands as a sharp break in the natural flow, beneath it you are surrounded by nearly a century of graffiti. Decades of art pieces, notes from the 60s, the 40s, and the modern day. The neon and pastel pallettes make the underside of the hulking bridge a cathedral of sorts, adorned with vibrant stained glass. The roar of the traffic above mixes and melts into the surrounding birdsong. We like it there.

      <h2>From October 2022</h2>
      <h3>The Living Machine; Living Computation</h3>
      <p>
        <a href='compsci.html'>Computers</a> in the silicon age are designed with the presumption of permanence. That for every input, there is an output. And ideally, when given the same input again, no matter how much time has passed the same output will be produced. The other bases of modern computation are those of rigid binary logic and uncompromising memory management. This inherently creates two fundamental flaws. First, systems such as this are unable to be scaled indefinitely (gotta look into this more). Second, the system is riddled with failure points. If memory becomes corrupted during a process, there goes your “permanence”, good luck getting the same output if your RAM cannot access necessary memory. Counterintuitively, a computer’s requirement for precise reliability results in it inevitable unpredictable failure. </p>
      <p>
        What if computers were designed to mimic biology? (In the true sense, not the <em>let’s make a neural net with as many nodes as we can and train a machine to recognize patterns</em>). What if computational elements of a machine were interchangeable, if the system was scalable and able to work around sudden local failures at the expense of perfect precision. Imagine a world where computational elements were but grains of sand that one could purchase by the ounce and simply pour into their vessel to increase computational ability or to replace lost ability from damage. The simple contact of the grains to one another facilitating the message passing. Imagine redundant safety faculties which allow the system to operate in acceptable ways while negating the effects of degradation or destruction. In the human body, the liver does not care if a toe is lopped off. The brain does not stop operating if an arm is broken. Even the brain within itself can withstand some level of trauma and destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, the dynamics of computation have been perceived as a binary battle between Control and Chaos. Control being the way of traditional computing in which authoritarian orders are issued by a central body; every element of a system has a job and <em>must</em> complete said job in exactly the way intended but only when explicitly asked to, if the element fails to follow this doctrine, the system fails. For small tasks, an authoritarian deterministic system is inarguably ideal, but perfect top-down Control cannot be effectively scaled, the larger the system, the greater the points of failure. Chaos, on the other hand, can be scaled infinitely. Though of course the absence of perfect deterministic Control leads to complete anarchy, turbulence, inherent unpredictablility, and lack of any real-world utility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if there is a median, a balance between the forces of Chaos and Control: Resilience, where a system is governed from the bottom-up where individual elements can act on their own with or without direction from others, a system that is resilient to abrupt change. Such a system will be at the mercy of some level of Chaos, inherently lacking the rigid, perfect, and deterministic characteristics of it traditional Control counterparts but at the benefit of being scalable, resilient.

      <h2>From July 2022</h2>
      <h3>The Career</h3>
      <p>
        My future is inarguably bright. A year from now, I will have a doctorate degree in physics with a focus in computational astrophysics. I will be Dr. Sean Lewis. I will have marketable skills in <a href='compsci.html'>high performace and distributive computing</a>, peer reviewed published research, and the stamp of approval that I can design long-term goals and commit to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, my bright future is entirely obscured by my inability to imagine myself succeeding in environments other than academics and my petrifying confusion as to what my <a href="purpose.html">purpose</a> in this world is meant to be.
      </p>
      <h3>The Land</h3>
      <p>
        Owning land. Knowing I own the earth beneath my feet, not just the building I sit in. Working that earthen land.

      <h2>From November 2018</h2>
      <h3>For Nicolas</h3>
      <article>
      <p>
        It is difficult to put into words how I am feeling in this moment and in the days after I heard of your passing. I became friends with you early on in elementary school. My memory often fails me when thinking back that far, fuzzy snapshots of time with you: walk-a-thon’s, wall-ball matches, sharing the usual series of July birthday parties with you, Johnnie Greco, and I. Though one oddly simple memory in particular is strikingly clear, and makes me smile even now. I believe it was in fifth grade where Mrs. Neidel caught us trying to cheat off one another during al math test. Looking back on it now, I cannot believe how oblivious we were. Secret hand signals under the desk? In what world could we actually get away with that!? I remember you and I yelling at each other afterwards, each convinced that it was the other one’s fault for not being sly enough. But, as always, anger resolved into laughter and our friendship strengthened because of it. Thank you for that memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle school, we grew apart: it’s difficult to maintain a friendship while attending different schools. You had a new group of friends and me mine. I did not see you again until the first year of high school. Even then, I did not talk with you, not because you had changed, but because you seemed exactly the same. The same energy, same smile, same social attitude. I think I was concerned that maybe I was the one that had changed and our friendship couldn’t resume because of me. What a strange thing to think, I wonder if you felt the same way about yourself. I wish I could ask you that now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know to an absolute certainty that, even after a decade or more, our childhood friendship would be rekindled with even the shortest of conversations. It’s a bizarre feeling to have. It felt so natural to still consider you a great friend of mine, even while our encounters were limited. I now believe that you are the first person in my life to teach me that a true friendship will last. No matter how many years pass, no matter how the world changes us, no matter where we are. I am proud and grateful to call you my friend, and to say that you always will be.
      </p>
        Love, Sean
