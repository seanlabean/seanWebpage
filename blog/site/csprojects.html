      <h2>Asides in the Life of Code</h2>
      <p>
        My style of engagement with programming projects has always troubled me, but I believe I am beginning to accept and revel in my passion. I learn in spurts and fits. I will periodically pick up an interest in a programming regime and consume as much content as I can on it as quickly as possible. This in turn fires up my passion and drive to engage with the topic further, I'll start a project, start learning, start day dreaming of a an incredible breakthrough a new level of understanding that will radically change my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then I'll get bored. And the work reveals itself to be much harder than I could have imagined. And I'll get discouraged. And I'll discover something else interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent a long time chasing my tail with areas of interest like this. I never feel like a finish a project or take it to the level of making money or encountering something profound. So eventually I decided: screw it, I'll embrace what fleeting interest I have and pull together a million half-assed passion projects. These will be my legacy, my foundational knowledge and experience upon which I will build my career. No need to bother myself with excruciating details and methods and lessons I dont understand, if a topic is truly interesting to me, I will naturally push my limits. Otherwise, why bother, this is just for fun anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy has worked very well for me lately and inspired the creation of my <a href="atavata.html">ATAVATA</a> persona: a digital manifestation of this malleable interest set of mine. Showcasing these projects to other people has helped me realize a lot of these are pretty damn cool and impressive, something to be proud of.
