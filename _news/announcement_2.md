<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlund_2" target="blank">Westerlund-2</a> is a very recently born star cluster with an age of ~1-2 Myr, dated by the current presence of a dozen O-type stars and near solar mass pre-main sequence stars. Visially, it provides an unprecidented look at the effects of O stars.
