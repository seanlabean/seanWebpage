### See my submission items here:
[Paper (PDF)][oral_qual_paper] and [Presentation][oral_qual_pres]

In my qualification exam, I utilized the magnetohydrodynamics grid code FLASH (Fryxell et al. 2000) to design protoplanetary disks and examine the effects of grid resolution and off-axis disk placement.

One thing to note: my presentation as shown here does not include any of the animations I had during the real thing. The animations (mostly) are appearing text, appearing images, and videos of simulations that played.

### Advice (still being added to):
Notice, that in my paper abstract I talk about "ram pressure stripping", supernova blasts and some other concepts that ultimately do not appear in my presentation. This is becasue I set out to do much more than I was able to accomplish. And that's okay! One of the things your commitee will look for is your understanding of what you <strong>could</strong> do and how you would do it.

You are in no way expected to be presenting ground-breaking discoveries in your qualification exam. But you will need a strong grasp of the background research your work is based on and some idea of how to expand/enhance your research to the point of a thesis project.
