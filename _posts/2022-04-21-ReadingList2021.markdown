### 2020 Reflections and a slow start in 2021

By the end of 2020, I was fairly confident in my interest in sci-fi/fantasy books. This wasn't entirely a surprise to me, my tastes generally follow a stereotypical trend of a nerdy science guy. But refinement is still possible on this front: why do I like some sci-fi stories but not others? What makes me excited to read one book but bored and tired in another? In addition to developing my knowledge of my favorite genre, I also noticed that I enjoyed nonfiction books that focused on current social issues. I also discovered Audible and wanted to ultilize the auditory version of storytelling especially when trying to absorb more intense topics or books that are just prohibitively long.

This year did not start off perfectly. As I had predicted, the 2 week break in reading I took over the holidays resulted in me starting two books in the first week of January which I promptly stopped after a few days I did not read or think about reading for months. At this point I felt the same about reading as I did other stressful aspects of my life such as my research: I didn't want to do it. At all. And entirely avoiding reading got easier and easier as the days, weeks, and months went on. Once I recognize I have failed a participatory task (like reading consistently) it's so easy to continue failing, this is true for other aspects in my life as well. The hardest part about breaking the cycle is engaging or re-engaging with the productive action. It wasn't until June of 2021 that I was able to start reading again. By that time, I had lost half a year to my procrastination and I no longer knew if it was possible to hit my goal of 14 books read in the year. We'll see that I do manage to reach and exceed this goal and that a few books in I actually stumble across a self-help book that helped me gain the vocabulary to describe my procrastination. 

### Sean's 2021 Reading List

[Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste) - Isabel Wilkerson <br>
What is racism, where does it come from, why does it persist, how deeply embeded is it in the systems and society of America? Isabel Wilkerson explores these questions and I believe more than answers them largely by relating the uniquely sinister brand of American racism to the millenia year old social caste system of India. This is not a history book. While racism's history is the central narrative focus, the topic and theme is how that history influences and drives the every day lives of Americans today, whether they realize it or not. Often, people cannot see the blight of institutional and societal subjugation, not because they choose to be blind to the state of the world, but because the blight has been so integral to the system itself that it appears natural and blemish-free. *Caste* is harrowing, amazingly read by Robin Miles, and a must read/listen for any and every American.
**- 4/5 stars**

[The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51029834-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue) - V.E. Schwab <br>
This book was recommended to me through Amazon kindle's algorithm. In the moment, I thought that it actually was a well-informed suggestion, somehow derived from my books I had previously purchased on the platform. In hindsight I now realize the book was just trending and popular among a significant portion of the userbase. So, this is my first dabble into very current pop culture literature! It was uneventful. *Addie LaRue* certainly has an interesting premise: navigating an immortal life where no one is able to remember you, but the young adult cheesy romance is not my style. I could see a great number of people loving this book, but I just cannot take written romances seriously (perhaps to my detriment).
**- 3/5 stars**

[A Promised Land](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55361205-a-promised-land) - Barack Obama <br>
Had to get this one on Audible, simply to listen to Barry-O's pleasant droning for 30+ hours. The book was okay. It chronicles Obama's life from childhood up until the end of his first term in office (iirc) while focusing mostly on his political life and its effects on his relationships and sense of self. Overall I am very glad I read it, definitely gave some insight into the first president that I was consciencely aware of as an adult.
**- 4/5 stars**

[Watchmen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen) - Alan Moore <br>
I've of course seen the movie, started watching the subsequent HBO show as well. Figured I might as well read the graphic novel. Admittedly, I did not realize that the TV show was a follow-up to the graphic novel and not the Zach Snyder movie. Double admittedly I had no idea that the movie and graphic novel diverged so significantly towards the end. I actually much prefer the story in the movie, feels much more polished and less random. Cool real, don't really understand the insane hype around it though.
