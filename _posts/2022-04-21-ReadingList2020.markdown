### What's Your Favorite Kind of Book?

Ok, a few months late on this one. In truth, a few **years** too late. In January of 2020, I resolved to start reading for pleasure. Leading up to this decision, I had convinced myself that I never truly enjoyed reading, and that any endulgance in any book of any kind was simply a byproduct of "my requirements" as a student or as the son of a bookworm of a mom. Certainly by my late twenties, the majority of my reading was confined to an academic setting (and therefore was horribly riddled with a SparkNotes-level interaction with the material). I wasn't especially bothered by this, it was just who I was: not a reader. But I could not shake the nagging uneasiness I felt whenever someone asked me: *what is your favorite kind of book?* My lack of answer to this question bothered me deeply, particularly because its broad scope felt like I *should* have an answer, infinitely more than what my favorite *individual* book. Everyone would have trouble picking one book as their favorite. But did I really have no idea as to the types of literature I enjoyed?

So, at the turn of the decade, I decided to find out.
