description: Day 1. Let's break some things!

Turns out web developement is fairly difficult! I have no idea what I am doing. Thankfully I am used to this by now, in the best way possible. Where's the fun in playing with a new toy if you don't break anything? Speaking of which, I somehow am no longer compiling the 'publications' tab on this site. No idea why. git diff-ing a previous commit shows no difference to any of the publication dependencies. Will need to look into this more. Updates to come!

6pm: New oddity. Though I have a header in my .markdown post file setting the date to be February 27, 2020 15:09:00, the displayed post date is 10:09. Apparently I am operating on Hawaiian-time...
