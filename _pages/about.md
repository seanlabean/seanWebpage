I received my <strong>B.S. in Physics</strong> in 2016 from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo and my <strong>M.S. in Physics</strong> in 2019 from Drexel University.

Currently, I am a physics Ph.D. candidate at Drexel University in Philadelphia. I design simulations to study the birth of stars. Specifically, I utilze the Dutch national supercomputer [Cartesius](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) and the software suite <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01132.pdf">Torch</a> to determine the effects of stellar radiation, winds, and supernovae on subsequent star formation. My current project is to use snapshots of giant molecular clouds from [galactic simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07214.pdf) as initial conditions to study direct N-body star formation in a [magentohydrodynamical medium](http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/).
