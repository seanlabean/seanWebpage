Currently, I am a physics graduate student at Drexel University in Philadelphia. I design simulations to study the birth of stars. Specifically, I ultilze the Dutch national supercomputer [Cartesius](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) and the software suite Torch (Wall et al. 2019) to determine how stellar radiation, winds, and supernovae affect subsequent star formation.
